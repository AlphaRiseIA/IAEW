#  I.A.E.W


This project is the practical part of my research work for the Bachelor's degree.

I will aply AI for processing text recieved from a image colors analyzer.We are using AI for getting an inteligent answer of how does the work area afect to us. This is in part a POC, I have no time for solving the *"aesthetics"* problems right now, but in a future is possible I go for a more professional apllication. 

I will upload here the practical part, the program is  barelly made on Python, and for some problems on the packages and my bad optimization, we will need to use 2 separated envirioments with 2 separated versions of Python.

I hope you enjoy my work!

## Installation

How to install and use my project?
It's easy in his own way but you need to follow __***Step By Step***__ my words.

### Windows
First thing first, we need to install Conda, wich is a Python IDE, it's used to manage projects and code on Python. 

To get conda, you need to follow [this](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html), there you will need to follow the docs and procceed to Installation.

When conda is ready, we need to build up 2 working enviroments:

- One using Pyton on any version on the **3.6.x**
- And the other one using Python on any version on the **3.9.x**

Once you got the 2 enviroments, you need to open a terminal one on each enviroment and one extra on the **Python3.9.x** , and you download the code on this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlphaRiseIA/IAEW.git
```
#### You don't really need to install by git, you can just install the repo zip file and unpack it.

Once you got the repository file, on the **Python3.6.x** terminal you need to get into the file to the TEXT directory. Then, you need to install the python requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are on the correct enviroment, you will succeed on the Installation. 

Now we go to the **Python3.9.x** terminal, and we go to the IMAGE directory. Then, you need to install the python requirements from that file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Another time , if you are on the correct enviroment, you will succeed on the Installation with no problems.

Now, on the extra terminal we got, we go to the PROX directory, and we install the python requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will probably don't have any problem.

Once the requirements are installed, we will run the code.

### Runing the code
For runing the code, we need to go to each terminal and run the python file with it's name.

```bash
python xxxxxx.py 
```
Here you can easily tab, till you get the file you want.
